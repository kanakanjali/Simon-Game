# 🎮 Simon Game
A classic memory game where the player must follow and repeat an ever-growing pattern of lights and sounds. With each level, the game becomes more challenging — can you remember the full sequence?

## 🔍 About the Game
The **Simon Game** tests your memory and pattern recognition.  
The game shows a sequence using four colored buttons (red, green, blue, yellow). Your task is to repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order. Each level adds one more step to the pattern.

## 🚀 What I Learned
Working on this project helped me understand and apply:

• DOM manipulation using JavaScript  
• Event handling for button clicks and keypresses  
• Use of arrays to track user and game patterns  
• How to play sound and trigger animations dynamically  
• Writing cleaner, modular functions  
• Debugging and testing logic step by step  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
• HTML – for the game layout  
• CSS – for styling the game board and buttons  
• JavaScript – for game logic, sound, and interactivity  
• jQuery – to simplify DOM operations and effects  
• Audio files – for button tones  

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Tap the "Start Game" button.  
2. Watch the pattern shown by the game (colored button flashes and sounds).  
3. Repeat the pattern by clicking the buttons in the same order.  
4. If you succeed, the game moves to the next level with a longer sequence.  
5. If you make a mistake, the game ends and prompts you to try again.
